# Elka Synthex 'Curtis' VCF

A clone of the VCF found in the Elka Synthex around the CEM 3320 IC. This project is still 'work in progress', a
prototype has been build, but it's not quite bug free. 

_the current design needs to be debugged_

## Status: Work in Progress

- done: first schematic & board design
- done: breadboard and test
- done: design frontpanel
- done: order PCB
